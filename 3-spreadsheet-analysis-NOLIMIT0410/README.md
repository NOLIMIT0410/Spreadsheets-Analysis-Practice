# Analysis on citywide payroll in NewYork

## **_Data set details_**:

- As a Junior student, I'm interested in how the Cityâ€™s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. This is the primary reason why I pick this dataset:**Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)**,from NYC OpenData [link to dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/k397-673e.json?). Due to my own capacity, I only chose the first 5000 rows as a sample.
- To make it clear , the original data was in Json file, and later turned into a csv file. The website only provides me API of the dataset, so I have to do a few steps to turn it into a Json file, using code below:
>- url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/k397-673e.json?$limit=5000"
>- response = requests.get(url)
>- data = json.loads(response.content)

### **_Some examplary rows are displayed below_**:

As you can from the table, there are few columns that do absolutely no help to our data analysis, such as last name, first name, midinit. Because it is very unlikely that a person's name has an influence on his or her wage. Beisdes, for this data I would focus more on working location instead of specific position, so I delete columns related to that as well. Codes are listed below:

>- column_to_delete = ['payroll_number','last_name','first_name','mid_init','agency_start_date','agency_name','leave_status_as_of_june_30','title_description']
>- df2.drop(column_to_delete, axis=1, inplace=True)

Another thing I notice, is that some of the workers are paid annualy, while some others are paid hourly. If that happens there is no point compare two workers as they are paid in different ways. So I choose to delete those that are paid hourly. Code is listed below:
>- df2.drop(df2[df2['pay_basis'] != 'per Annum'].index, axis=0, inplace=True)

## **_Analysis_**
As we are analyzing workers' wage in a specific industry, we got understand what the wage is composed of. Each worker has a base salary, a regular paid salary, paid for extra working hours, and other paid. So a specific worker's wage will be _regular paid salary + extra-time paid+ other paid_
To have a clear vision, I calculated mean, minimum, and maximum for all the variables listed above. It helps us to have basic idea how the distribution works.
A few statistics are listed below as an example:
- Average base_salary=72755.70445
- Average total_other_pay=6093.497739
- Maximum o2_paid per hour=1118.185455
- Average total wage=64934.51287

The result proves that wage can be very very different between two workers that have seemingly same abilities in the same industry. Besides, some workers receive higher because they work extra hourse while others don't. The most hardworking employee work near 1118 hours extra in a year.

For the second part, I assume there might be a wage difference in workers from different locations. Using filter tool, we know that this dataset divided NYC into five parts: Bronx, Richmond, Manhattan, Queens, and BK. So I calculated workers'total wage statistics by their working locaton. Some key statistics are listed below:
- Average total wage=64934.51287
- Average total wage(BK)=64610.08719
- Average total wage(Queens)=51281.58444
- Average total wage(Richmond)=71744.31935
- Average total wage(Bronx)=61706.2602
- Average total wage(Manhattan)=69272.92636

Clearly there is a difference between workers'wage from different locations. On average, workers in Richmond earns 20000 dollars more that workers in Queens each year.

_Tips_: More conditional-statistics are shown in [Modified_data](https://github.com/dbdesign-students-spring2024/3-spreadsheet-analysis-NOLIMIT0410/blob/main/data/Modified_data.xlsx)

To have a better vision, a chart is also included in my analysis:
![base salary chart.](https://github.com/dbdesign-students-spring2024/3-spreadsheet-analysis-NOLIMIT0410/blob/main/data/chart1.png)
![total salary chart.](https://github.com/dbdesign-students-spring2024/3-spreadsheet-analysis-NOLIMIT0410/blob/main/data/chart2.png)

From the dotplot we can see, there is no clear distribution in workers' wages, no matter based on base salary or total salary. Wages are literally everywhere. Why can the wage difference in this industry so big? These two charts indicate that there needs to be further analysis on the sample. Workers might receive different wages because they have different positions

## Extra-credit

This assignment deserves extra credit because the original data is a one with 5k rows and 18 colunms. It is so big that this exercise becomes so complicated and time consuming. I believe I derserve this extra credit. O.O
